The first _FakeNarratives_ project meeting took place virtually on February 1, 2022.

_FakeNarratives_ is a joint project with the University of Bremen and the University of Leipzig funded by the _Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)_. The core idea of the project is to analyse the narrative structures of disinformation in videos from public and alternative media shared on social networks.
