I successfully defended my PhD with the title [_Unsupervised Quantification of Entity Consistency in Real-World News_](https://www.repo.uni-hannover.de/handle/123456789/11812).

My deepest gratitude goes to the defense committe, especially to my supervisor Prof. Ralph Ewerth, as well as to my friends, colleagues, and family who supported me during my PhD.
