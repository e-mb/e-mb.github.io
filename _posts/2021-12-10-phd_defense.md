I successfully defended my PhD thesis entitled [_Unsupervised quantification of entity consistency between photos and text in real-world news_](https://www.repo.uni-hannover.de/handle/123456789/11812).

My deepest gratitude goes to the defense committee, especially to my supervisor Prof. Ralph Ewerth, as well as to my friends, colleagues, and family who supported me during my PhD.
