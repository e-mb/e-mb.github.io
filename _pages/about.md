## about

Hi, my name is Eric MÃ¼ller-Budack. I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in the [Visual Analytics Research Group](https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/research-groups-and-labs/visual-analytics) of the [TIB -- Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology](https://www.tib.eu/en). My main research interests include automatic multimedia indexing, multimedia and multimodal information retrieval, deep learning for multimedia analysis and retrieval, as well as sports analytics.
