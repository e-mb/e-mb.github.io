## about

Hi, I am Eric MÃ¼ller-Budack, a postdoctoral researcher in the [Visual Analytics Research Group](https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/research-groups-and-labs/visual-analytics) of the [TIB -- Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology](https://www.tib.eu/en). My research focuses on automatic multimedia indexing, multimedia and multimodal information retrieval, deep learning for multimedia analysis and retrieval, as well as sports analytics. My work aims to push the boundaries of how we understand and interact with multimedia content, leveraging cutting-edge AI and machine learning technologies.
